hiii, I'd usually go by Pierce, but Apple or Macca also works. I'm very shy though I love to make friends! 

my **BEST** friends : Ezra, Marty, Sun, Ezekiel, and Lian.

If I come up to you and do small talks, either I'm complimenting or need friends ^_^

I have attachement issues and also diagnosed with *BPD*, I will get really worried and panicked if the people I am talking with doesn't respond or talk to me. I am easily attached to someone and sometimes showed it openly, sorry in advanced if it makes you uncomfortable. But **PLEASE** learn about BPD first before judging!
